2013-09-17  sto@iti.es

	* Version 1.3.
	* Added support to export HOST and REQUEST variables to the PAM ENVIRONMENT.
	  Thanks to Ruben Jenster for the  initial patch, his version is available
	  from https://github.com/r10r/ngx_http_auth_pam_module; my version uses his
	  implementation but only if the user sets the ``pam_auth_set_pam_env``
	  flag.
	* Fixed bug from http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=+721702
	  (ngx_module_t commands array should end with a ngx_null_command); the bug
	  was already fixed on the PAM_ENV patch, but I forgot about it until I went
	  back to my svn repository to add the debian patch... better latter than
	  never... ;)

	* Version 1.2.
	* Fixed possible memory leak when authentication fails, pam_end has to
	  be called to free memory (thanks to Neil Chintomby).

2009-01-26  sto@iti.upv.es

	* Version 1.1.
	* Fixed ngx_log_debugX calls, no we use the correct X value on each
	  call.
